----------1️⃣ Multithreading in C (pthreads)----------
Creating and joining threads
Detaching threads
Thread execution and synchronization
Passing arguments to threads

----------2️⃣ Mutexes and Synchronization----------
Mutex = prevents multiple threads from accessing the same resource at the same time.
Deadlocks: When two or more threads are waiting on each other indefinitely.
Race Conditions: When multiple threads access and modify shared data at the same time unpredictably.



----------3️⃣ Timers and Sleep Functions----------
You'll need precise time tracking to determine when a philosopher should eat, think, or die.

----------4️⃣ Memory Management----------
Since multiple threads access the same memory, be careful with malloc(), free(), and global variables.
Using one global variable per program can be tricky.
